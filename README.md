The Blood Donor Connect Portal is a web application built with the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) designed to streamline blood donation by connecting potential donors with recipients in need. Users can register themselves as donors by providing essential details such as blood type, location, and contact information. Registered users can then log in to access features like searching for compatible donors based on blood type and location. Additionally, users can update their profiles as needed and view alerts if they attempt duplicate registrations.

The project includes a secure, token-based authentication system, ensuring safe login for both users and admins. This portal ultimately aims to make it easier for individuals to find blood donors quickly and reliably, contributing to a more efficient and accessible blood donation process.
